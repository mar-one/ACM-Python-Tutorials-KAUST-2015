Each tutorial level is given on a separate day. The morning sessions of the tutorials cover general Python topics of various levels; the afternoon sessions are devoted to specific techniques, packages, and problems that could be easily solved in Python. The final day will have a 2-hour session bout MPI programming in Python.\r\n\r\n## Python Tutorials: Day 1 - Basics\r\nThis is a beginners' level session, in which we focus on the basic syntax of the language and essential functionality. The session is hand-on.\r\n\r\n**General topics:**\r\nGetting started with Python: Using iPython notebook, basic usage and syntax\r\n\r\n**Special topics:**\r\nUseful tools for automated script generation; terminal commands execution and parsing results; working with files: reading, parsing, using encodings, and writing to files.\r\n\r\n## Python Tutorials: Day 2 - Intermediate topics\r\nThis session is focused on stepping beyond basics and also on some useful numerical packages used by scientists world wide: Numpy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. The session is hand-on.\r\n\r\n**General topics:**\r\nPython libraries, programming approaches in python, advanced syntax usage, input and output.\r\n\r\n**Special topics:**\r\nScientific calculations with NumPy and SciPy, advanced plotting techniques with MatPlotLib.\r\n\r\n## Python Tutorials: Day 3 - Advanced techniques\r\nDuring this session we go further from procedural programming to object-oriented style and functional approaches widely used in professional Python programming. The session is hand-on.\r\n\r\n**General topics:**\r\nClasses and objects, object-oriented programming, functional programming, memory management.\r\n\r\n**Special topics:**\r\nOptimization in Python with OpenOpt; machine learning in Python with Scikit-Learn.\r\n\r\n## Python Tutorials: Day 4 - MPI with Python\r\nDuring this session you will learn about Message Passing Interface (MPI) programming approach in high performance computing and about how to work with it in Python. The session is lecture-like.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
